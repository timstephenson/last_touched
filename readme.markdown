Sample Last Accessed File
=========================

1.  Write a brief program in one of the above programming languages that, given a list of file names, will display the name of the mostly recently accessed file.  For example, if /tmp/a was the most recently accessed file, then
    $ program /tmp/a /tmp/b /tmp/c
    /tmp/a
    would be correctly formatted invocation and output.  In a comment at the top of the file, please explain the conditions under which your program might fail.
2. Provide an equivalent implementation of #1 in any other programming language you like.  In this program's comments, please explain any different limitations that apply to this implementation from that in #1.
